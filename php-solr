Description-en: PHP extension for communicating with Apache Solr server
 The Apache Solr PHP extension is an extremely fast, light-weight,
 feature-rich library that allows PHP applications to communicate
 easily and efficiently with Apache Solr server instances using an
 object-oriented API.
 .
 It effectively simplifies the process of interacting
 with Apache Solr using PHP and it already comes with built-in
 readiness for the latest features.
 .
 The extension has features such as built-in, serializable query
 string builder objects which effectively simplifies the manipulation
 of name-value pair request parameters across repeated requests.  The
 response from the Solr server is also automatically parsed into
 native php objects whose properties can be accessed as array keys or
 object properties without any additional configuration on the
 client-side.
 .
 Its advanced HTTP client reuses the same connection across multiple
 requests and provides built-in support for connecting to Solr servers
 secured behind HTTP Authentication or HTTP proxy servers.  It is also
 able to connect to SSL-enabled containers.
 .
 PECL Solr 2+ is only compatible with Apache Solr Server 4.0+.
