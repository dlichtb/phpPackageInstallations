 This package provides the /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php CGI interpreter built for
 use in Apache 2 with mod_actions, or any other CGI httpd that supports a
 similar mechanism.  Note that MOST users probably want the php-fpm package
 that provide FastCGI support.

 open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited
