Description-en: swiss-army knife for reading and writing XML files
 XML_Serializer creates XML files from data structures and vice versa.
 It serializes complex data structures like arrays or objects as XML
 documents. You can create any XML document without the need for DOM
 access.
 This package includes an unserializer facility that creates PHP data
 structures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints
 are available. If not, it will try to guess how it has to be
 unserialized, doing exactly what you expect it to do in most cases.
 .
 Since version 0.8.0 the package is able to treat XML documents similar
 to the simplexml extension of PHP 5.
