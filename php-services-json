Description-en: PHP implementaion of json_encode/decode
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, http://json.org) is a lightweight
 data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy
 for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
 Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. This
 feature can also be found in Python. JSON is a text format that is completely
 language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of
 the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl,
 and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange
 language.
 .
 This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It is
 intended for use with client-side Javascript applications that make use of
 HTTPRequest to perform server communication functions - data can be encoded
 into JSON notation for use in a client-side javascript, or decoded from
 incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to Javascript, and can be
 directly eval()'ed with no further parsing overhead.
